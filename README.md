## Data source : [Kaggle California Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices/data)

## Brief summary about dataset

#### 'Hands-On Machine learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow', a recent book by Aurélien Géron, uses this dataset in its second chapter. Because it contains a manageable set of variables, is just the right amount of toy-like and complicated, and only necessitates basic data cleaning, it's a great starting point for developing machine learning algorithms.

#### The data contains information from the 1990 California census. So although it may not help you with predicting current housing prices like the Zillow Zestimate dataset, it does provide an accessible introductory dataset for teaching people about the basics of machine learning.
